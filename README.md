# SwapStreet
## What is SwapStreet?

SwapStreet is a Web application that allows for people who live locally to swap favours. Members 
offer to do favours in exchange for other favours within a certain proximity to each other.
The app is aimed for people to get to know their neighbours through those interactions. Thus, not 
only do they help each other, but also a happier local community is established.
“SwapStreet” is similar to NextDoor that way, but is focused only on exchanging favours without 
money playing any part in that exchange.
There is no anonymity on SwapStreet; each member has to reveal their identity to all other members
and the app has to be able to enforce that and be able to establish a member’s identity.

## How does SwapStreet work?
Say, I am good at painting walls. I just moved into a place where the lawn needs to be cut. I neither 
own a lawnmower, nor do I know how to cut grass.
I become a member of the site. There I can see everyone who is also a member of SwapStreet.
I select all members who have advertised the skill of mowing a lawn and advertised that service.
They may need some painting done, in which case, this is a direct exchange.
If not, I could still contact them and they could provide the service to me and that favour could be 
swapped for another favour or favours they might need now or in the future.
The team had decided to go for a design where each new member is given, say, 20 SwapStreet coins
to trade for favours at the beginning. This is their “Welcome to the community gift”. 
If the new member choses to use up the coins right away, they could, but they will have to earn 
more for future favours they might need done.
Favours examples:
- Drive someone to the supermarket or to the doctor
- Sew a button, undone hem, other more involved sewing tasks
- Clean the house at end of lease or on a regular basis
- Babysit
- Companion for an elderly person
- Weed the garden
- Paint internal/external walls
- Any other favours that might require certificate and the favour provider is willing to do via 
- SwapStreet e.g. electrical or plumbing work (called service).
